ABOUT THE APP - STUDYFLOW
Studyflow is a kinda modern, AI-powered note-taking platform designed to make studying and productivity effortless. It combines real-time note editing, intelligent autocomplete, and DALL·E-powered visuals to give students and professionals a smarter way to learn, revise, and remember. But mostly just to take notes during lectures more efectively. This was my final year project and i decided to go with a project i really relate to and would want to be incorporated in real life even though i know there are other much better note taking applications out there like notion-which was my main inspiration in making this project, I strived to create this and here it is.
